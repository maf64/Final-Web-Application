Emad’s Feature:

Login and activation email.
This feature allows the user to create an account which information will be stored in the database. Upon siginin up, a user will receive an activation email in the email address they entered in the registration form. When clicking on the activation ling in the email, the database record for that user wil;l be changed to reflect an active status. A user can use their newly created credentials to authenticate in to the website. An anuthenticated user wil not be able to view the cities’s table. However, after successful logging in, the user should be able to view the table and perform another functions.
